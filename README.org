#+TITLE: Configuration

** For NixOS
This is an experimental repo to transition towards NixOS. This will be updated on a regular basis with more and more configs.

TODO: The home manager is getting flake support in the next release. Currently the config for HM is a bit cluttered. Hope the next update makes it simpler.
