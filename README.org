#+TITLE: Configuration

** For NixOS
This is an experimental repo to transition towards NixOS. This will be updated on a regular basis with more and more configs.

** To Install
1. set $USER to create user.
2. home manager does not work with nixos-install for now, you have to comment it out and then uncomment it after installation finishes.
3. host specific configs {your machine name like yourname@hostname} are present in hosts/{hostname}. configuration.nix and $USER-home.nix are expected here.
